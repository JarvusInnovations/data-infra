# Technical Onboarding (WIP)
:::{admonition} Migrate to the new Table of Contents structure
:class: warning
A new Table of Contents structure was introduced in `v0.11`.
To migrate your old TOC structure to the new structure, you have a few options:

- **Manually migrate your TOC**. See [this blog post](https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/updates/2021-06-18-update-toc.html) for one example migration from an old TOC structure.
- **Use the migration tool**. This automatically generates a new TOC from your old one, though may alter the formatting slightly.
  To do so, use the following command:

  ```shell
  jupyter-book toc migrate path/to/_toc.yml -o path/to/_toc.yml
  ```

# Juniper documentation

Welcome to the docs!

## Editing documentation

The docs content all lives under `docs/`, with some top-level configuration for how the docs website gets built under `mkdocs.yml`. To add new sections/articles, simply create new directories/files under `docs/` in Markdown format.

To preview the rendered docs website live while you work, run `script/docs-server` from your terminal (requires Python 3.5+).

Changes to docs will be published to the online docs website automatically after they are merged into the `main` branch.

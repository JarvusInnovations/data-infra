# Notebooks
## JupyterLab
For Python users, we have deployed a cloud-based instance of JupyterLab to creating, using, and sharing notebooks easy. This avoids the need to set up a local environment, provides dedicated storage, and allows you to push to Github.
Make sure you're set-up with JupyterLab here

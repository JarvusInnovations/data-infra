      Each row represents a GTFS realtime feed (combination of ITP ID, URL number,
      and realtime data type) that was present in our extraction list on the given date.
      Note that a feed can be added to the  list at any point in the day
      and this table contains no information about extractions success or failure;
      i.e., a feed may be listed here even if no data was successfully pulled,
      or if only partial data was pulled. Primary key is composite of
      calitp_itp_id, calitp_url_number, date, and type.
